Simple Bookmark Manager using CodeIgniter

This is a sample Bookmark Manager app I wrote while trying out the CodeIgniter framework.

A few things about the project :

What it can do :

- Add bookmarks with the fields : URL, tag,description
- Search for bookmarks
- Show all bookmarks

Structure:

- The model is "bookmarks_model" which handles data storage,retrieval and logic
- The views are split into header,footer templates, a searchbar template, and an index page to generate the body of the page
- The controller is mainly showbookmarks
- The stylesheet is in the css folder

Database:

- The database configuration can be done in the application/config/database.php file
- The database consists of a "bookmarks" database with a "bookmarks" table
- The "bookmarks" table has the following fields: id,link,tag,description
- link is a non-empty field, the rest can be empty

Also :

- I hosted it using XAMPP, it can be accessed using base_url/index.php/showbookmarks
- Add these files to your existing CodeIgniter structure, and you should be fine
- There are issues with the CodeIgniter license, read more here : http://t.co/q4tINphB
